Circular Economy Calculator - Detailed Implementation Guide
Overview
Create an interactive impact calculator that displays Factory Appliances Online's contribution to the circular economy through refurbishment and redistribution of electronics. The calculator should show real-time cumulative impacts with engaging visualizations and allow users to explore potential impacts of their own orders.
Core Metrics to Track
1. E-Waste Diverted
What to measure: Total weight (kg) of electronics prevented from entering landfills
Calculation method:

Track cumulative weight of all refurbished/redistributed items
Use device-specific average weights (e.g., laptop: 2.5kg, desktop: 8kg, phone: 0.2kg, tablet: 0.5kg, washing machine: 60kg, refrigerator: 125kg)
Visual representation: Icon of diverted waste bins or electronics with a prohibition symbol
Display format: "XX,XXX kg of e-waste diverted from landfills"
Equivalent context: Convert to relatable comparisons like "Equivalent to X garbage trucks of waste"

2. Resource Conservation
What to measure: Raw materials saved by not manufacturing new devices
Calculation method:

Track key materials per device type:

Rare earth metals (neodymium, dysprosium)
Precious metals (gold, silver, copper)
Plastics and glass


Example: 1 smartphone contains ~0.034g gold, 0.34g silver, 15g copper, 25g aluminum
Visual representation: Icons of raw materials or mining equipment with reduction arrows
Display format: Separate counters for major materials - "XXkg copper saved", "XXg gold conserved"
Equivalent context: "Enough copper to wire X homes" or "Gold equivalent to X wedding rings"

3. Carbon Footprint Reduction
What to measure: CO2 emissions prevented by avoiding new manufacturing
Calculation method:

Use lifecycle assessment data for CO2 per device type:

Smartphone: ~70kg CO2 to manufacture
Laptop: ~350kg CO2
Desktop: ~500kg CO2
Refrigerator: ~1,000kg CO2
Washing machine: ~750kg CO2
Visual representation: Cloud/smoke icons with downward arrows or trees planted
Display format: "XX,XXX tonnes of CO2 prevented"
Equivalent context: Convert to "Equivalent to X cars off the road for a year" or "X trees planted"



4. Circular Value Created
What to measure: Economic value recovered through refurbishment
Calculation method:

Track the difference between scrap value and refurbished resale value
Calculate job hours created through refurbishment operations
Include cost savings passed to customers
Visual representation: Circular arrow with dollar signs or economic flow diagram
Display format: "$X.XX million in value recovered" and "X jobs supported"
Equivalent context: "Supporting X full-time technician jobs" or "Saving customers $X on average"
